## What is it?

Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources, Web dynamic applications.
It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

Apache JMeter features include:

Ability to load and performance test many different applications/server/protocol types: 
 -  Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET,...)
 -  SOAP / REST Webservices
 -  FTP
 -  Database via JDBC
 -  LDAP
 -  Message-oriented Middleware (MOM) via JMS
 -  Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)
 -  Native commands or shell scripts
 -  TCP
 -  Java Objects

Full featured Test IDE that allows fast Test Plan **recording (from Browsers or native applications), building and debugging.**

[**Command-line mode (Non GUI / headless mode)**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#non_gui) to load test from any Java compatible OS (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, ...)

A complete and [**ready to present dynamic HTML report**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html)

[**Live reporting**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/realtime-results.html) into 3rd party databases like InfluxDB or Graphite

Easy correlation through ability to extract data from most popular response formats, [**HTML**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#CSS/JQuery_Extractor), [**JSON**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#JSON_Extractor), [**XML**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#XPath_Extractor) or [**any textual format**](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Regular_Expression_Extractor)

Complete portability and 100% Java purity

Full multi-threading framework allows concurrent sampling by many threads
and simultaneous sampling of different functions by separate thread groups.

Caching and offline analysis/replaying of test results.

Highly Extensible core:
 -  Pluggable Samplers allow unlimited testing capabilities.
 -  **Scriptable Samplers** (JSR223-compatible languages like Groovy)
 -  Several load statistics may be chosen with **pluggable timers**.
 -  Data analysis and **visualization plugins** allow great extensibility and personalization.
 -  Functions can be used to provide dynamic input to a test or provide data manipulation.
 -  Easy Continuous Integration through 3rd party Open Source libraries for Maven, Gradle and Jenkins


## The Latest Version

Details of the latest version can be found on the JMeter Apache 
Project web site (https://jmeter.apache.org/).

## Requirements

The following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter:

*  Java Interpreter:

    A fully compliant Java 8 Runtime Environment is required 
    for Apache JMeter to execute. A JDK with keytool utility is better suited 
    for Recording HTTPS websites. 
    Java 9 is not yet supported as of version 3.3.

*  Optional jars:

    Some jars are not included with JMeter.
    If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory

    * JDBC - available from the database supplier
    * JMS - available from the JMS provider
    * [Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) - 
    only needed for SMIME Assertion

*  Java Compiler (OPTIONAL):

    A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a
    precompiled Java binary archive. _Note that a compiler is required
    to build plugins for Apache JMeter._

## Installation Instructions

_Note that spaces in directory names can cause problems._

 * Release builds

   Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure.

## Running JMeter

1. Change to the `bin` directory
2. Run the `jmeter` (Un\*x) or `jmeter.bat` (Windows) file.

### Windows

For Windows there are also some other scripts which you can drag-and-drop
a JMX file onto:

* `jmeter-n.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI test
* `jmeter-n-r.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test
* `jmeter-t.cmd` - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test

## Documentation

The documentation available as of the date of this release is
also included, in HTML format, in the `printable_docs/` directory,
and it may be browsed starting from the file called `index.html`.

## Reporting a bug/enhancement

See [Issue Tracking](https://jmeter.apache.org/issues.html)

## Build instructions

### Release builds

Unpack the source archive into a suitable directory structure.
Most of the 3rd party library files can be extracted from the binary archive
by unpacking it into the same directory structure.
You can also use Ant to download the required library files:

```sh
ant download_jars
```

Any optional jars (see above) should be placed in `lib/opt` and/or `lib`.

Jars in `lib/opt` will be used for building JMeter and running the unit tests,
but won't be used at run-time.

_This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are not
downloaded by other JMeter users._

If you are behind a proxy, you can set a few build properties in `build-local.properties` for ant to use the proxy:

```
proxy.use=true
proxy.host=proxy.example.invalid
proxy.port=8080
proxy.user=your_user_name
proxy.pass=your_password
```

You might also want to skip some tests - that are failing without proper access to the internet - by adding some more
properties into `build-local.properties`:
```
skip.bug52310=true
skip.bug60607=true
skip.batchtest_Http4ImplPreemptiveBasicAuth=true
skip.batchtest_SlowCharsFeature=true
skip.batchtest_TestKeepAlive=true
skip.batchtest_ResponseDecompression=true
skip.test_http=true
skip.test_TestDNSCacheManager.testWithCustomResolverAnd1Server=true
```

### Test builds

JMeter is built using Ant.

Change to the top-level directory and issue the command:

```sh
ant download_jars
```
_This only needs to be done once; it will download any missing 3rd party jars._

```sh
ant
```

This will compile the application and enable you to run `jmeter` from the `bin`
directory.

```sh
ant test [-Djava.awt.headless=true]
```

This will compile and run the unit tests.
The optional property definition is required if the system
does not have a suitable GUI display.
